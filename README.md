**Hey, so I need help.**

There is alot of tasks needed for this stuff, which includes:

* UI updating
* Updating Search Bar in navbar
* Profile picture and page
* Login (Although, I'm probably doing that myself)
* All Backend-Functionality

And these are the ones in the top of my head. So if you want to help, dm me in Discord, which my username is pika!#0566.
Or just do a pull request, but I will probably not check it out until the next day.

**We can do this!**
